This repository contains code for the paper:

*B. Habib, E. Isufi, W. v. Breda, A. Jongepier and J. L. Cremer, "Deep Statistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation," in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, [doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3290358](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3290358).*

## Data
This repository includes the synthetic data used for case studies as well as the scripts developed to generate the data.

## Models and case studies

This repository contains:

- data.py: Helper functions:
    -  to get features for nodes and edges in specified grid
    -  to calculate power flow values based on given voltages and grid features
    -  to describe the loss function for DSS2 in gsp_wls_edge
    -  to retrieve data for training and testing from pickle files

- dss2_run.py: Main script to create a GNN model, train it with WLS and testing

- networks.py: Script defining different GNN models based on PyTorch Geometric library and PowerFlowNet repository defining a GNN model for Power Flow: https://github.com/StavrosOrf/PoweFlowNet

- loadsampling.py: Contains helper functions to perform sampling on the load profiles to generate randon load scenarios

- toy_network.py: PandaPower script to create scenarios on different grids and gather a synthetic database

Some pre-trained models are available in the saved_models folder and can be load in the case_study.py file, using keras library

Data to train your own model is available in the datasets folder. It is not needed if using a pre-trained model

Data generation:
- data_gen.py: Script to set the scenarios and networks and to generate the datasets
- pp_to_dss_data.py: Contains the helper function to create a DSS2 instance from pandapower 
- npy_to_tfrecords.py: Script to get a .tfrecords format for the DSS datasets, which is the data format used in TF2 during training


Necessary packages: Pytorch, Torch Geometric, Pandas, PandaPower, NumPy
